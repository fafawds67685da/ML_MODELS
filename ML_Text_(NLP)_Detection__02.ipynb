If you are already making 100k, or in a position to make 100k, I&#39;d strongly advice against spending any more time in the drudgery to make even more money. Unless the time spent is enjoyable and meaningful. The real cost of waste is not the money you lose, but actually living life in the moment the way you want to.\n",

It is not that simple giving daily expenses etc. Otherwise everyone would be rich, just not realistic but a nice clickbait. He should rather define wasting time after asking the question and getting the answers. Wasting time is when you stop growing as a person, wasting time is the time you do not spend with your loved ones but at work. I expected more from him to be honest.\n",

Paid work is purely to support these activities, which makes that work meaninful as well, since those things a typical worker does are very important for other people to be able to do the same kinds of activities.

I just stopped wasting my time and used what I had: my hands and energy (no money, no inheritance) I finished law school for comparison and now I don’t have a job , I wake up when I please and live off the land. About 4k a month it’s fine.\n",

There is no way 80 percent of his audience said they waste 6 hours per day for the simple reason that most people will tell you that their time is filled, even when it&#39;s just doodling on the phone. Just do the test and ask around yourself.<br><br>What he is projecting is his own way to lead his life. It is based on a career and money making, it is so ambitious that his body is not following him, he has strange eating habits, almost died from Corona, is depressive, got addicted to a medicine that is known to do that to almost every patient etc. His life style therefore is obviously wrong and stressful.<br><br>Instead, focus on the topic &quot;time&quot; and think for a minute how it is possible to &quot;waste&quot; something that actually is just a concept - like Peterson&#39;s ideas of career, moneymaking etc. The &quot;waste&quot; aspect turns up only if you are not in balance with yourself, when you believe <a href=\"http://s.th/\">s.th</a>. is missing and when you are not &quot;in the m oment&quot;. Fair enough, to quote his favorite saying. For finding a way to be in the moment it is not necessary to focus on career and money, as many Buddhist monks could teach you. If you like Peterson&#39;s values, fine, go for them, if not, you may find your luck just in doing what you want, as long as your basic needs are fulfilled. Check studies what people dying really missed in their life, and you get a clearer picture. It&#39;s mainly not having spent enough time with friends and family and taking work and career too seriously. So be warned.\n",

Cause creates effect, and its not so much that the effect is so strong, its that i question the cause in hindset or put so much weight behind the cause that it will affect me. Not really present, just living in this before or what&#39;s gonna happen after, knowing theres always an alternative outlook or handling of a situation, i never know what to really bank on, strives so hard to make concepts and issues appear black and white, knowing damn well it usually never is. Never really knowing if I&#39;m compensating or just being the voice of an unheard circumstance, or out of place in general.

We are sick with a fascination for the useful tools of names and numbers, of symbols, signs, conceptions and ideas.<br>Life is like music for its own sake. We are living in an eternal now, and when we listen to music we are not listening to the past, we are not listening to the future, we are listening to an expanded present.<br> Life exists only at this very moment, and in this moment it is infinite and eternal, for the present moment is infinitely small; before we can measure it, it has gone, and yet it exists forever.<br> The art of living... is neither careless drifting on the one hand nor fearful clinging to the past on the other.

I learned the hard way that I must take time to minimize commitments and or responsibilities and use that time to focus on relieving stress, relaxing, having fun, and preventing burnout. Best medical advice I ever got. <br><br>It is all about what you perceive as productive. A monk may find a full day of meditation as productive. Some may find just waking up and spending a day chilling at the beach just watching the waves as productive because you are doing exactly what you planned and or want to do. <br><br>I am generally stressed when doing something I HAVE to do. Instead of doing what I want to be doing at that time. When driving on the freeway trying to get to wherever each is going in that early morning rush hour traffic, I love when I see someone with one of those license plate frames and bumper stickers that say, “I’d rather be ………….”    I say to my self, “Yeah, I am so with you on that, I’d rather be doing ….. whatever it is I would want to be doing at that time also. <br><br>I have found that I am happiest and most relaxed when I am doing exactly what I want to be doing at the time,  even if that is just sitting on the couch binge watching a show. I am doing what I want to do when I want to do it. And I no longer feel guilty about it. Others may find it unproductive by their standards, that is their problem. I no longer allow the beliefs of others to try to guilt, dictate and control my thoughts about myself.

And inverting it from &quot;I have to do X for Y time&quot; to &quot;I only have Y time to do X&quot;, it turns it into a game, a challenge. <br>&quot;I only have 5 minutes to clean my room.&quot;<br>How much can I clean in 5 minutes? <br>How much focused work can I get done in 30 minutes?\r<br>\r<br>(Unrelated: Paradoxically I found studying for 45+ minutes much easier than 15-30, because it takes me about an hour to develop deep focus.)\n",

When a light wave interacts with an electron, it forms particle characteristics in the form of a photon electron coupling or dipole moment.

Don&#39;t overthink it. Focus on what and who you love, and be grateful. While I admire JP, sometimes his talk stresses me out, projecting hypothetical futures. Do your best in each moment, set goals, then let go. Remember to smile, even amidst chaos. Embrace death; it&#39;ll all be over soon. I&#39;d rather not waste time on others&#39; conditioned ideas. Just let go and focus on what motivates you. Leave regrets behind and aim to improve each moment. Ignore others&#39; shoulds; you know what&#39;s best.

Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? 26 Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? 27 Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life[e]?<br><br>28 “And why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. 29 Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. 30 If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you—you of little faith? 31 So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ 32 For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. 33 But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. 34 Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.\n",

            "414. Those desiring spiritual encounter and mystical experience, those wishing to know god intimately, fasting from all things but god will soften your heart and bring you humbly closer to he. Go into the place of earnest whisper, and simply ask to know him, his love. As you reach for his heavenly kingdom, you may just find all your little earthly worries becoming evaporate, silenced by these tastes of new experience. May you plant these seeds from above onto the earth, into your life renewed. Prayerfully ask to be a sword for he, an agent for great change in service to humanity. Seek to please our lord in thought, word and deed. Dwell upon serving others best, for we are but one though we are also the many, the miraculous marvellous magnificent. Brothers and sisters, you am I, just as I am you. God is the source of all things, may we remember just how dependent we are. Where would I be without those before me, around me, above me. Meditate on the purpose of your desire. Become an observer, steadfast and vigilant in your awareness of the moment. Step aside from those discomforts and afflictions of the heart and mind, please know truly that it serves a purpose and is a compass into gods embrace. Your thoughts and feelings are all rooted somewhere, I wonder what their lesson is.  Bless the world as your mirror and teacher. Ponder your spiritual inheritance and your worthiness. Peace and freedom is gods bounty to those who seek the righteousness in all things, they that work for god, for love. Spiritual dettachment is the natural progression for those that love unconditionally, those that find the teachings within relationship, those that mend old wounds and open new doors. It’s a joy to seek the remedy to what ails us, so find the light that comforts and avails you even in your darkest of dark. In his ceaseless works, I am sustained completely. Christhood is for everyone, we are each so needed, treasured and special to god. Your Christic destiny awaits you, if that is your wish. Become exemplary. Strive in heart and mind to become his love in all its guises in action, within your life, to those around you and those afar. You learn best by giving your best, experience is the grand teacher. Now when ready cross your arms, and as you stimulate your nipples with tenderly love, bring a keen eye into your sacrum area. It is there you will feel a point of great power and potential and with your intention, will and focus you mightily just arouse this potent spark from its slumber and upwards towards your crown it will rise. Do not be afraid, for all things work for the glory of god. Drink from the waters of thy own cistern, but a teardrop will suffice. Our mothers nature is so good to us, may we find healing in all that she offers. Living foods will uplift our spirits. Make your heart pure and whole. When something of your unrest becomes divinely understood, your pains will abate, for god is absolutely merciful. The redemptive spirit is beautiful. The soul lost and broken is apt for great growth, for suffering has purpose, you chose it out of your benevolent heart. It is love that inspires great change, so pray it upon your enemy. Be kind and gentle with your animal self, your wounded self, and your true self you&#39;ll become. Knowing your plight affords you compassion. Judge not, compare not, for each life is between they and the creator. To share your own wisdoms is always loving and wise, remember intention is everything. Forgiveness will allow grace to find you. God never gives up on you, it is gods delight in your return to he. Our god knows our heart of hearts, the timbre of our being, for he made us and is always with us, within us. You are seen, heard, and loved, always and forever, that is his truth and promise. God knows our needs best. With a devout acceptance and trust in gods plan, may we hurt a little less and give a little more. Let suffering be not in vain, may we ask our heavenly father why so. Even in the darkest dark one can find the light if one so chooses, such is the immutable law of god, the freedom of choice, our free will. Take solace in knowing that you battle with a great enemy, the confusion and sway of darkness and yet it is to our service, may you find this truth within and without. We are not truly anything negative or dark. Where there is his light, there is no dark. God is the source of all darkness, how brave we all are to fall for he who wished to know himself better. We all have a desire to feel connected to something, even those in suffering. It is a connection to the divine that we all truly seek. The giver of eternal life and all that is good. And If we only knew we would never have, similarly, if we knew better we would have. Ignorance serves god, trust in he. It is a great burden indeed we who have caused harm to others, may god ease our suffering if it so accords to his plan. We cannot move the immovable burdens of darkness alone, so pray to god, for it is his great joy to serve you. Justice know that we will all acknowledge intimately and completely all that we do. Those devoted to his natural laws will come to fear nothing. In the darkest dark will his truths be made known ever so clear. All we need is the shimmer of hope. Perspective changes everything. We are but children in a playground, students in a school, christening soldiers of his love and light divine, and there are many many levels. It is an honour and duty to follow my sacred path, I am eternally grateful for this opportunity here and now. May your mysteries become enlightened. Dream yourself awake. What wouldn’t infinite love not do for itself, the absolute good, the unimaginable marvel, the impossible possible, the wonder of the never ending story. God is the ageless poet, the supreme storyteller, the surreal real. May your becoming be filled with glee, as you remember his creation as astonishment. You are not a mistake, your experience in not by accident. You are perfect as you are. How can we not love and have reverence towards the lord of all that is.  Through devotion to he, to his truth, we come to recognise that we are made in his image, what an amazing gift we have been bestowed. Love is our essence and may the light of gods truth become unmistakably and forever more so self evident that your beingness and reality be made anew, a rebirth into spirit. Words are a thousand weapons, may you tender them carefully. Remember to give thanks. Know that if you reject these words you are rejecting he who sent me. If you feel called to share this message please do. I wish you the very best on your journey of journeys, bless you.\n",

It&#39;s a great time to save up money and learn responsibility with that money.  Try to save at least $2000-$5000 and put that money into a Roth IRA.  Try to add at least $100 to it each month for the rest of your life.  By the time you reach retirement, or if something happens and you can&#39;t work all the way to retirement, there is going a LOT of money in that Roth IRA which you can draw from.  Also, many kids don&#39;t that your social security in the U.S. is based on what your earned during your work career so don&#39;t depend on your spouse - if it ends in divorce or something, then you&#39;re income from social security will be practically nothing, so always have a job.

I’m in a situation right now where I don’t have that. I’m 38 and worked since I was 13. But 6 years ago I moved from Denmark to Argentina for love, she’s a doctor and I’m an IT consultant so it was easier for me to make the move. Jobs here are scarce after the pandemic and due to hyper inflation. I started a business which failed, something I’ve never tried before, and I don’t even enjoy selling nor am I very good at it. I don’t like giving people the idea that they need something, when I know they don’t. So now I’m jobless, and struggling, not financially but existencially here, in a very different place, far away from home. I’ve only tried being without a job for 3 months before this. My girlfriend and her family members are all highly successful people, doctors, lawyers, restaurant owner etc which makes it harder to fail. But I’ve never given up and will continue trying\n",

All of these self help gurus leave out the personalization of fulfillment and never point out the circuitousness of being “better”.

A lot of y&#39;all seem to be missing the point and trying to justify &quot;wasting time,&quot; likewise saying &quot;wasting time is not wasted time.&quot;<br><br>The point Jordan Peterson is trying to make to you is that if you do not consider the time you&#39;re &quot;wasting&quot; as &quot;wasting,&quot; because you&#39;re using it for recovery, then it&#39;s not wasted time. You have personally defined what time you are using as wasted or not. <br><br>What he&#39;s asking of you is to reflect upon your actions and how you perceive your time used. If you don&#39;t consider naps/entertainment that you enjoy as wasted time, and the way you are currently living will continue the way it is without a negative result to your future, then you should be content or happy with your current life and future.<br><br>If there is something you&#39;re missing, then that means that you are not working towards your personal goal of a happy future with the time and resources you are given. In that case, you are simply lying to yourself. <br><br>&quot;I hope I get a bigger house someday,&quot; is something some of you might be hoping for. Are you working jobs that pay sufficiently for that to become true? If not, then ask yourself what is stopping you from doing that, and ask yourself if a bigger house is something you actually want. And, is what is stopping you out of your control? Lastly, do you know what to do to get what you desire?<br><br> For everyone else, just replace bigger house and jobs with respective desires and resources to get said desires. E.g. girlfriend, social skills, and location.<br><br>Now, this isn&#39;t a fight of &quot;You are missing out because _ helps me,&quot; this is a co-op of &quot;What do you do that helps you? Maybe it can help me too.&quot;\n",

So it varies mostly by state and by the type of jobs which you could realistically qualify for and then get. Because you can have the qualifications for a position but maybe it&#39;s not your strong suit and you never land that job. So your time is really only worth the amount that whatever company hires you is paying someone of you&#39;re level of schooling. And during low points in the economy like we&#39;re experiencing many businesses will want their workers on the clock as few hours of the week as possible for them to get by with. That means you get to your job everyday and they work you to the bone. They&#39;re working you much harder given the amount they are actually paying you to be there but the second they can go without that extra person, you&#39;re lucky if you don&#39;t get asked to clock out and go home. It&#39;s a brutal the way capitalism chews you up and spits you out, taking advantage of you in every way they legally can before they don&#39;t need you any longer.

If you not mentally ready for something, and that&#39;s not anything emergent, leave it later.\n",

There is a huge area between not doing anything and waiting for death and doing something.<br>That huge area is a product of your belief system, your genetics, your ideals, your characteristics and your surroundings. It all influences you. Life can hit you so hard that suddenly your whole area of work changes. You can dissect every hour or every week of your life, but that is just too analytical for me. For those people who think of life as a measurement system of goals achieved, its valid that they dissect life in such a way. I am certainly not gonna criticize that. You can take these advices from Dr Peterson, but know that its all up to you how to deal with that pressure of advice receiving.  They may be well intended but they also carry the aggressive message of altruism. We already have enough pressure in life.\n",

In my mind it was all I ever wanted. I&#39;m 41 now. In between everything I felt empty for some reason. I began losing everything. began suffering from attachment learning how difficult it was to let go. I literally have nothing now and it&#39;s the happiest I have ever been in my life. Why ? I&#39;ve practiced detachment unconsciously. The weight of worrying towards everything we&#39;re attached to brings misery. Peace is priceless. Once we&#39;ve gain peace nothing can replace it. Some people live a life time and will not accomplish it. Peace is very difficult to accomplish without detachment towards what we have gained. I gave 8 yrs of my life of not wanting to gain anything till I accomplished peace which was worth it. As we speak i am ready to gain it all back by 100 times. This time things will be different. I will not be attached and prepared if life decides to take it all away. As long as I have peace I&#39;ll be fine. Literally I can live in the woods and still be ok. Many will not be able to handle losing it all. Like the gentleman said it really is all bullshit. You will learn it as a rookie once you&#39;ve gained anything you&#39;ve ever wanted and thought it will make you the happiest person ever. Peace &amp; gratitude, good bless you all.\n",

I think it&#39;s actually healthy for people to vege out only after a day and a week of work. Your mind needs rest and to be able to process events of the week.

In other words, a dishonest answer based on my perceived belief of another. Furthermore, the whole time=money equivalency is false, especially if half the time you are not wasting is at a job you can stand, rather than one you love. Spending time, the most valuable thing you have, doing something you do not love, is wasteful and does not promote growth. Sure, a good job, even one you do but don&#39;t love, can be rewarding to your future self but that doesn&#39;t ensure personal growth.

            "870. My time is worth $50 an hour when I&#39;m working not when I&#39;m wasting time. Wasting time is devoting 20 years on becoming a doctor and realising that you&#39;re old already and you just wasted your youth on saving money and studying. Life is a waste as you end with nothing, enjoy the moment, nothing is the way you think it is.\n",

Most people have the most fun in their lives when they are young, so investing all your time for the future can rob you of the best time of your life. Maybe a little balance.\n",

            "880. I am making...per hour...the least that I have made in the last 6 years. That being said, my housing is half of what it was 6 years ago and instead of over an hour of driving to and from work each and every day, I spend 2 minutes because I work a 1/4 mile down the road. I did it so that I can be more lazy. That was the point. So my time could be spent how I want it to be, and I wouldnt charge for my personal time what I get paid at work. I certainly wouldnt compare it to minimum wage either. My job is lucky to have me. <br><br>When you start equating every minute and hour of your day into an hour wage that can be potentially wasted, your start monetizing everything, and that is definitely not living. Your worth at your job is one thing, your time outside of work is another and it shouldnt be equated to &quot;dollars&quot;. The dollars value changes all the time, usually decreasing. <br><br>You can have your every minute accounted for so as to not lose a single dollar and get smashed to death in a freak car accident involving a semi. Happened to my best friend who spent a decade working 120hours a week to retire at 50, only to die right before his 52&#39;nd birthday.\n",

            "882. It seems that the overall significance here is that the productivity in which Jordan Peterson is going for here is that the time for productivity fits your overall intended goal or purpose. It seems many people misinterpret “productivity” as if it has to do with some type of employment or something similar to that. <br>The overall productivity is subjected to the person enabling the productivity for themselves to fit an overall objective goal. <br>Now how wasted time is seen in such an equation is only prevalent to the person able to recognize that error for themselves. <br>This is a great way of setting your mental discipline into motion to drive yourself to a goal oriented mindset that will encapsulate your overall personal lifetime achievement processing\n",

            "900. &quot;The time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time.&quot; —Bertrand Russell.  I am retired. I did not enjoy much of my nearly 50 years of work life, my so called productive time, it was pretty much wasted time. I have a kinda significant savings that I don&#39;t use and don&#39;t intend to ever use. I have been living on about $1,500 a month for the last 6 six years and I have never been happier. (I live in South America) Anyway I learned the hard way which I don&#39;t think many people learn is that being productive is bullshit, it is a false value created for you by the powers that be. Being content is the most important thing in the world, whatever it takes.\n",
            "901. &quot;I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, &quot;  Henry Thoreau , spent two years living in a tiny cabin.

Who is he to what we should be doing with our time, defending the American Capitalist ideology in all it’s glory Strive for wealth creation above all on our finite planet which is heading to ruins. Truth is there is no meaning to our being apart from that we are. Go to the middle east or asia they spend hours a day in some way devoting their time to their religions.

            "914. &quot;Wasting&quot; is a term that is vastly overused these days. Just because you aren&#39;t working doesn&#39;t mean you are wasting time. If you feel you are wasting your time, then you  are. We get to choose what defines wasting. Not others. If you are seeking a proper balance between work and the rest of your life then that time is not wasted. We are just poorly informed and bred to be easily guilted into doing something, even if it&#39;s wrong.\n",
            "915. I get what hes saying, but it&#39;s only because everybody isn&#39;t concerned with studying or chasing high paying jobs that the system works. We absolutely need all the people that do the jobs that require little to no education, otherwise society wont  function. Part of being an academic or a high earning person is the mentality to say that those that dont have that  are wasting their life. <br>Happyness is a successful life, not how much you earn or what career you have.  Some of the most miserable people I know earn a high salary or have a high standard of eduction. That personality trait of constant striving can leave you forever chasing an illusionary dream of what if. <br>Be the happiest you can be. that&#39;s the best version of you, not what other people tell you it is.\n",
            "916. being productive and TIME.... dont waste your time..... ---- (it seems to me)..... VALUES.... there are Spiritual/religious meanings to life and then there is  - The biological MEANING OF LIFE is (I have found and come to believe) SURVIVAL..... The survival of the individual, the family/clan, the nation (genetically) and of mankind as a species ---  All of the mechisms that the human body has to overcome problems, are there to help us survive and the differences among people help mankind survive... (metabolic syndrom to survive famines VS an immune system that creates many antibodies to survive pandemics, etc. ) +  various emotions and emotional states + various inherent personality types (according to Jung the 16 personality types and/or according to the 1980s personality typology there are a basic 25 personality types = the big 5 OCEAN)......  These mechanisms help us survive.... + Modern psychology says that once a child is an adult he/she is free to decide to live where they choose ( next door, or cross country, in a different country or on a different continent) - temperment seems to play a big role in selection of place to live.... So a person might have 1-4 kids and some or none might live next to you as you age.....  So having children so that your family/clan and nation lives on is a big meaning of life but there is no guarantee that you will see your grandchildren grow up..... Because their best place for survival might not be next to you....  (The situation in Ukraine with seniors and parents of young children now is a perfect example),  - I worked with seniors 90+ for about 5 years and the more money they had, the more likely they were to be living in an upper middle class to rich senior living facility among their peers (often 100s of miles away from their kids and grandkids)...... Oh, and I have seen much severe illness and dying.... Modern medicine prolongs the life of the significantly ill even for people who have lost basic self-care ability (sometimes for months, years and even decades).... frail for years..... this is draining on money/finances, time and other resources and decreases the amount of children that adults have (if the parent/s of the adult are dependents on the adult or on a system).....  The modern western idea, that survival of the individual must be accomplished at all costs leads to the younger generations having a smaller chance at survival (less kids, less time to gather resources, less money to save for future problems, etc.)..... So  modern western (Christian) values many times come into conflict with the biological need/s of survival.....  The survival of the  family/clan, the nation (genetically) and of mankind as a species ---  I have come to believe that doing something that helps at least one of these biological goals for survival may be a really good meaning to life  (fireman, police officer, nurse, teacher, pediatrician, teacher assistant,  foster parent, adoptive parent, etc.)......  How a person feels and the emotions he specifically feels in his specific situation a something a bit different. -- So where does keeping humanity and decreasing human suffering come in with this....????\n",
